Sure! Here are the divisibility rules for numbers 1 to 15:

1. Divisibility by 1: Every number is divisible by 1.

2. Divisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. In other words, the number is divisible by 2 if it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

3. Divisibility by 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

4. Divisibility by 4: A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

5. Divisibility by 5: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5.

6. Divisibility by 6: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

7. Divisibility by 7: Divisibility by 7 does not have a simple rule. It usually requires division to check if a number is divisible by 7.

8. Divisibility by 8: A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.

9. Divisibility by 9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

10. Divisibility by 10: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0.

11. Divisibility by 11: Divisibility by 11 does not have a simple rule. It usually requires division to check if a number is divisible by 11.

12. Divisibility by 12: A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.

13. Divisibility by 13: Divisibility by 13 does not have a simple rule. It usually requires division to check if a number is divisible by 13.

14. Divisibility by 14: A number is divisible by 14 if it is divisible by both 2 and 7.

15. Divisibility by 15: A number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.

These are the divisibility rules for numbers 1 to 15.
